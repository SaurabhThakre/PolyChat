## Chat App with Audio Translation

Millions of people use chatting app for instantaneous communication anywhere in the world.
It helps to connect people from different countries and different languages. So, we are trying
to build an application that let two people with different language chat in their own language
with text or speech. In this project we focus on developing model to recognize text from speech.
This will be used in application to help user send audio message which will be translated and
received by receiver in his own language. The main objective of the project therefore is to
produce chat application that everyone can use without the language barrier.

Currently various chat applications does not have a feature to chat with a people speaking
different languages in their native language directly using there app. Or they need to copy the
text from chat add it to any translation app and then translate it. Similarly to send message in
their language write it in translation app, translate it and copy message and then send it in the
chat app. But when it comes to Audio message it becomes a problem. With these problems into
consideration, we have decided to create a chat application which will help the people to chat
using their native language with the people speaking different languages using text-to-text or
audio-to-audio translation.
